# Welcome to the best team in IDFCTS!
----
Prepare yourself for challenges, for perfection, for 2000 pictures of cats, to learn to clap your hands to the rhythym, and tasty cakes.

Your first challenge is to figure out what the red button does, but be careful...

DBaaS is the technological leader and innovator of the IDF private cloud. Where we go, others follow.  
Our responsibility is to manage and maintain the necessary database infrastructure for clients requiring managed databases.   

Our workday is mostly spent writing code - automations which create and control database clusters, scripts which provide us and others with easy maintenance actions, and monitoring.  
We often research new open source tools, and carefully plan architecture which allows us to safely deploy any new software. We think ahead - small mistakes in planning can lead to massive problems later on.
We also spend lots of time developing powerful monitoring capabilities, to provide us and our clients with some of the best insight in the world.  
Finally, we spend some time responding to client communications, in the form of service tickets.  

We are willing to go above and beyond our responsibilties in order to provide the best experience possible to our clients, but we also have very clearly defined areas of responsibility.  

Welcome to the team!
