  * Enable AOF and RDB
  * Create a RDB dump
  * Restore the database once with AOF, and one with RDB
  * Go to your Redis Enterprise Cluster
  * Create a single shard database without replication and enable AOF, put some keys into it
  * Using `rladmin` determine which node the database shard is hosted on, and shut down the Redis services on that node
  * Turn the node back on, Explain the output of `rladmin status` command
