## Goals
* the trainee will be familiar with Redis replication
* the trainee will understand Redis Enterprise proxies and replication

## Tasks
* Is Redis replication synchronous or asynchronous?
* How can one use the other replication method?
* How does Redis replication works?
* What is replication Id?
* Do the following tasks:
  * Deploy a Redis server with replication
  * Using `redis-cli`, How can you check the replication status?
  * Using `redis-cli`, How can you check the role of the shard?
* What is Quorum? Why is it needed?
* Who is responsible for detecting and fixing proxy failure in Redis Enterprise?
* What are Redis Enterprise proxy policies?
* What is Rackzone-Awareness in Redis Enterprise Cluster?
* How can I check a database shard and endpoint location in Redis Enterprise Cluster?
* How do I manually failover a shard?
* What is `slave_ha_grace_period`?
* Do the following task:
  * Make sure your Redis Enterprise Cluster is working
  * Create a database with sharding and replication
  * Change the default proxy policy to `all-nodes`
  * Failover the database to a different node
  * Shut down the node where the database master shard is located
  * Turn the node back on and fix the cluster
  * Shut down all nodes of the cluster
  * Turn them back on and fix the cluster
