## Goals

- the trainee will be familiar with Redis replication
- the trainee will understand Redis Enterprise proxies and replication

## Tasks

- Is Redis replication synchronous or asynchronous?
- How can one use the other replication method?
- How does Redis replication works?
- What is replication Id?
- Do the following tasks:
  - Deploy a Redis server with replication
  - Using `redis-cli`, How can you check the replication status?
  - Using `redis-cli`, How can you check the role of the shard?
- What is Quorum? Why is it needed?
- Who is responsible for detecting and fixing proxy failure in Redis Enterprise?
- What are Redis Enterprise proxy policies?
- What is Rackzone-Awareness in Redis Enterprise Cluster?
- How can I check a database shard and endpoint location in Redis Enterprise Cluster?
- How do I manually failover a shard?
- What is `slave_ha_grace_period`?
- Do the following task:
  - Make sure your Redis Enterprise Cluster is working
  - Create a database with sharding and replication
  - Change the default proxy policy to `all-nodes`
  - Failover the database to a different node
  - Shut down the node where the database master shard is located
  - Turn the node back on and fix the cluster
  - Shut down all nodes of the cluster
  - Turn them back on and fix the cluster
