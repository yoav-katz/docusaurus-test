## Goals
- Understand PostgreSQL internal processes

## Tasks
* Understand PostgreSQL memory usage and explain the following configuration:
  * `work_mem`
  * `max_connections`
  * `shared_buffers`
  * `maintenance_work_mem`
  * `effective_cache_size`
* Read about PostgreSQL processes (postmaster for example) and understand what kind of processes are there and what are their purposes
* PostgreSQL ACID:
  * How is `ACID` used in PostgreSQL 
  * Transactions
    * What are transactions?
    * Why are they important?
  * Transaction Isolation
    * How does Postgres keep isolation between transactions?
  * What is MVCC?
  * Locks
    - Types of locks
    - Deadlocks
    - Lock table in `ACCESS EXCLUSIVE` mode and do the following:
      - List all locks in database
      - Open another connection to the DB and try to query the locked table
      - Write query to show what process is blocking your last query (show also the blocking query and blocked query)
      - Terminate the blocking process from the second connection to DB (pg_terminate_backend)
  * Vacuum
    * What is the Vacuum process?
    * When is a row deleted from the database? When is a tuple deleted from the disk?
    * What are the responsibilities of the `Vacuum` process?
