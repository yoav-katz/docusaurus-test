# Welcome to the DBaaS online training program!

Here you will learn all there is to know about the secrets of creation.. as well as Databases.  
Theres is much to learn, but with great power comes great responsibility- and the fate of our clients' data rests on our shoulders.

In the chapters that follow, you will learn about our team's main areas of responsibility, Postgres, MongoDB, and Rundeck.  
You are not expected to be an expert when you finish, but by the time you're done, you should be a fully capable team member.

We are glad to have you aboard!
