## Goals
- The trainee will know Splunk basic terms:
  * `Index`
  * `Metrics`
  * `HEC Token`

## Tasks
1. What is Splunk?
1. Why do we need Splunk?
1. What is `Index` in Splunk?
      * What are the differences between **events** index and **metrics** index?
1. What is `HEC Token`?
      * Why do we need HEC tokens?
      * What is default index in HEC token?
1. Create the following (using Splunk automation in `Rundeck` or ask Splunk team for help):
      * Events Index
      * Metric Index + HEC Token

#### Make sure, when you create the indexes, the index name must include your project name. For example dbaas team only have permissions to see indexes with the pattern: \*dbaas\*. Most projects only have permissions to the pattern: *\<project_name\>*\*
